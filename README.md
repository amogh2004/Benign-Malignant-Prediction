# Benign-Malignant Prediction
Predict whether a Mammogram Mass is Benign or Malignant.</br></br>

## Description
A lot of unnecessary anguish and surgery arises from false positives arising from mammogram results. If we can build a better way to interpret them through supervised machine learning, it could improve a lot of lives.

## Built with
* [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) - is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with structured (tabular, multidimensional, potentially heterogeneous) and time series data both easy and intuitive. </br>
* [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) - NumPy is a python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.</br>
* [scipy](https://pypi.org/project/scipy/) - The SciPy library depends on NumPy, which provides convenient and fast N-dimensional array manipulation.</br>
* [joblib](https://pypi.org/project/joblib/) - Joblib is a set of tools to provide lightweight pipelining in Python. </br>
* [scikit-learn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/) - scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.</br>
* [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/) - Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.</br>
* [seaborn](https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/) - Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It is built on top of matplotlib and closely integrated with pandas data structures.</br>
* [tensorflow](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/) - TensorFlow is an open source software library for high performance numerical computation. Its flexible architecture allows easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), and from desktops to clusters of servers to mobile and edge devices.</br>
* [Keras](https://pypi.org/project/Keras/) - Keras is a high-level neural networks API for Python.</br></br>
